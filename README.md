 ## Description 
    The purpose of this assignment was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Utilizing the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own Resources:https://youtu.be/QEu8_5bYm-w
